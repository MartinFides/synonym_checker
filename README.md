# Synonym Checker
## Description
This program is designed to determine whether two words are synonyms or not, based on a given synonym dictionary.
The program follows specific rules to make this decision.

### Rules for Synonym Determination
1. If the pair of words is declared synonymous in the input, then they are synonyms.
2. Being synonyms doesnâ€™t depend on order, e.g. if big is a synonym for large then large is a
synonym for big.
3. We can derive the synonymous relationship indirectly: if big is a synonym for large and large is a
synonym for huge then big is a synonym for huge.
4. If two words differ only by case, they are synonyms, e.g. same is a synonym for both SAmE and
SAME.
5. If none of the above rules can be used to decide whether two words are synonyms, then they
are not.
